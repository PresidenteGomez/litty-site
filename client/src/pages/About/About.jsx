                    <p className="lead mb-5">The world and its leaders are under huge societal pressures to transform the way we generate and consume energy.
                              We have a limitless access of energy through the sun yet we fail to utilize it. At Litty Solar we want to help
                              people redefine how they produce and consume their energy. We see a surge in public perception that renewable energy
                              is the future, and we believe that dearly as well. We want to enable Minnesota, Puerto Rico, and Mexico capture
                              the limitless energy and help them construct the societies of tomorrow.

                    <p className="lead mb-5">Litty Solar was founded in 2018 by Alonso Gomez Jimenez, a young immigrant from Nayarit, Mexico. The idea came about
                              as he looked to find solutions to reduce crime and violence in underserved communities and to assist in disaster-relief
                              efforts in Puerto Rico. If communities are empowered with economic equity, crime and violence could see a deep
                              reduction. At the same time, he wanted to help people attain electricity throughout their homes in places like
                              Puerto Rico, where more than 50% of households don’t have power. Litty Solar’s forward outlook is unlike companies
                              of it’s kind. Litty Solar wants to tackle issues that are of dire importance in the world: sustainability and economic
                              equity.
